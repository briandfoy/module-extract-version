	* No code changes. Fix link in README.pod.

1.114 2021-01-20T09:54:21Z
	* freshen distro, dump Travis CI, add Github Actions

1.113 2016-12-07T13:59:05Z
	* Fix a perl5.8 issue with Makefile.PL. It shouldn't use // !
	Even though this module requires v5.10, I want the modulino
	Makefile.PL to work with tools that use earlier perls.

1.112 2016-12-05T19:39:04Z
	* Remove prereq.t test. I'll do that locally.
	* Hide some packages from PAUSE.

1.111 2016-10-18T01:54:39Z
	* Support v5.12 and v5.14 PACKAGE NAMESPACE VERSION BLOCK
	* Andrey Starodubtsev contributed the changes as part of
	Hacktoberfest.

1.01 - 2011-04-26
	* Bump to a full release version. The module isn't going to
	change that much now.
	* Add an example to the synopsis.
	* Other than that, it's the same old code. :)

0.12 - 2008-09-16
	* Moved everything to git
	* Added corpus to the no_index bit of META.yml by using
	the latest features of ExtUtils::MakeMaker

0.11 - 2008-08-09
	* Bumping this to a release version
	* CPAN Testers seems to like it
	* If you find pathological cases, please let me know about them

0.10_01 - 2008-04-03
	* This is the initial version of my module to extract module versions
	without running module code. I stole most of it from PAUSE's
	mldistwatch.

1.10_01 - 2011-11-29
	* Use a safe compartment
	* Require Perl 5.10 so I can use named captures.
