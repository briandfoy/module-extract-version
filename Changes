Revision history for Perl module Module::Extract::Version

1.01 - 2011-04-26
	* Bump to a full release version. The module isn't going to
	change that much now.
	* Add an example to the synopsis.
	* Other than that, it's the same old code. :)

0.12 - 2008-09-16
	* Moved everything to git
	* Added corpus to the no_index bit of META.yml by using
	the latest features of ExtUtils::MakeMaker

0.11 - 2008-08-09
	* Bumping this to a release version
	* CPAN Testers seems to like it
	* If you find pathological cases, please let me know about them

0.10_01 - 2008-04-03
	* This is the initial version of my module to extract module versions
	without running module code. I stole most of it from PAUSE's
	mldistwatch.

1.10_01 - 2011-11-29
	* Use a safe compartment
	* Require Perl 5.10 so I can use named captures.
